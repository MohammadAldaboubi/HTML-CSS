            <p>Millennia ago, war was waged between humanity and demons from the Underworld. The Demon King Mundus had his sights set on conquest, intending to subjugate the human realm to his rule. With his massive army capable of wiping out almost any being who dared oppose him, his downfall came at the hands of one of his own kind; the Legendary Dark Knight Sparda rebelled against the demons to prevent mankind from suffering under Mundus’ tyranny. With the use of his sword, his blood and a mystic amulet, he managed to seal away the entrance to the Underworld through the unholy tower called the Temen-ni-gru, at the cost of the greater portion of his power.

                After benevolently ruling over mankind, Sparda vanished and descended into legend before passing away, but not before marrying a human woman named Eva. Their union would lead to the birth of half-human, half-demonic twins named Dante and Vergil, who were each entrusted with weapons and halves of Sparda’s amulet. Eva cared for their children as a single mother, but their happiness would end when the twins turned 8 years old. Mundus’ forces had caught wind of Sparda’s death and attacked the family, leaving the brothers as orphans and separating their paths for the next several years.
                
                Distraught over this traumatic incident, Vergil began to believe that his human side was the source of his weakness, and embraced his demonic heritage. He travelled the world to find whatever remained of Sparda’s power, and soon learned of the Temen-ni-gru’s legend by way of a mysterious individual named Arkham, who explained that it can only be restored by one who bears Sparda’s blood and possessed the same artifacts used to seal it in the first place. Later on, Vergil learned of Dante’s survival and existence as a demon hunter, leading to the sons of Sparda eventually battling each other and clashing both their blades and philosophies together.</p>

He is a paranormal mercenary, private investigator, and vigilante Devil Hunter dedicated to exterminating evil demons and other malevolent supernatural forces, operating in his shop known as "Devil May Cry."</p>

               Weapon Yamato: A katana once wielded by Sparda to seal the true Hell Gate, it became Vergil’s signature weapon after it was passed on to him as a heirloom. The sword is imbued with dark magic, allowing it to cut through almost anything. Its signature move, the Judgement Cut, demonstrates this by having Vergil cut through the fabric of reality itself. Outside of it, Vergil practices a form of Iaido in direct combat, sheathing the sword when not in use and pulling it out for quick blitzing attacks.

               Weapon Beowulf: A pair of flash gauntlets and greaves which Vergil uses for different martial arts techniques. This Devil Arm contains the soul of the Lightbeast Beowulf, one of the guardians of the Temen-ni-gru.  After being weakened in battle against Dante, he attacked Vergil and was slain; his soul being reforged into a new weapon. Said to be blessed by the power of the sacred light, attacks with Beowulf emit large bursts of energy which compliment its hard-hitting strikes. Vergil can charge it up further to increase their attack potency.

               Summon Sword: These spectral copies of Force Edge are Vergil’s primary form of ranged attack, due to his distaste towards firearms. Vergil can fire these during his combos, and warp towards any foe or surface these land on with Trick. He can also detonate blades embedded into enemies for extra damage.
